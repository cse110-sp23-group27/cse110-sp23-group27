# Using Reset Button After Cards are Selected

## Context and Problem Statement

Currently for our tarot card page, after the user picks three cards and sees all the responses, they have to go to the 
burger bar to go back to the home page and reset everything. This seems a little inconvenient for the user, so we thought
it would be better if there is a reset button that appears after the user finishes selcting their three cards.

## Decision Drivers

* Improved user experience
* Not too difficult to implement

## Considered Options

* Use a reset button at the end for the user to go to home page
* Only use the reset button on the burger bar
* Use a reset button for just resting tarot (not home page)

## Decision Outcome

We decided for now that we will have a reset button after three cards are selected that will take the user back to the home page.
Something we are considering is removing the home page, since we no longer have three fortune telling options anymore, so once we
decide this, the reset button may just go to the start of the tarot page. Or we may possibly have two separate buttons for tarot 
page an home page but this id TBD.

### Consequences

* Good, because it improves user experience
* Others are TBD based on what happens after implementation


## More Information

TBD after we implement the button and based on how we decide to change the website
