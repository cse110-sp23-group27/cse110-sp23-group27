# Checkpoint 1 Documentation
Currently, we have made two architectural decisions, but as we are currently working on the pipeline and the implementation, more will come. The first ADR we have made was about the implementation of the responses storage. We debated whether we should save the responses in an array for easy storage, but opted to use JSObjects to represent the tarot cards since they would be easier to update. Our second ADR was the use of ESLint over other linters since it was the most convenient to use and easy to implement. We make more ADRs once we decide what other tools we want to use for the pipeline as well as what APIs if any we will use.
