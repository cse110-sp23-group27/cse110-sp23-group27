# What the ADR is for
Discussing our design choices in the overall context of our project.

## Context and Problem Statement

From the beginning of our project we had decided to implement multiple types of fortune telling ideas in the form of Tarot Cards, Bone Tossing, and Oomancy (egg patterns). However, as we reach closer to our deadline, we've come to realize that we won't be able to create quality content for each of those pages if we tried to do everything. So in order to maximize the quality of our project, we've decided to cut out both the Bone Tossing and Oomancy elements and have everyone focus solely on Tarot Cards. These were our original idea, and the one we've made the most progress on. 

<!-- This is an optional element. Feel free to remove. -->
## Decision Drivers

* {The amount of time we have left forces us to reevaluate what we can get done at our pace of work.}
* {Adding in new elements and making everything work between pages would expand into problems with conflicting elements, so it's easier to focus on one product}
* … <!-- numbers of drivers can vary -->

## Considered Options

* {Cutting just Oomancy and trying to get Bone Tossing in}
* {Cutting everything out except Tarot Cards}
* … <!-- numbers of options can vary -->

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "{Cutting everything out except Tarot Cards}", because it's the best option to focus our whole group on one idea. If we have half our team working on Bone Tossing and the other half on Tarot Cards, we'll run into the issues we did during our first sprint, where even just working on Tarot Cards between 2 teams (animation and text) caused us to become disorganized and confused on whose tasks were whose.
