# Adding Labels that Represent for The Past, Present, and Future 

## Context and Problem Statement

After we have done the implementation of the tarot cards, feedback and usability tests have demonstrated that we may struggle to remember which of the three selected tarot cards represents the past, present, and future. 

The problem question now is: "How can we enhance the user experience by clarifying which picked card corresponds to the past, present, and future?"

## Decision Drivers
- We wanted to enhance user experience and ease of use.
- We also wanted to ensure a correct response that corresponds with the picked card.

## Considered Options
- Adding labels directly above each picked card (The Past / The Present / The Future)
- Providing an interactive guide within the app.
- Developing an optional labeling feature that can be activated in the settings.

  
## Decision Outcome
Chosen option: *"Adding labels directly above each picked card (The Past / The Present / The Future)"*, because it addresses the user's response most directly, enhances the overall user experience and can be implemented promptly.

## Consequences
- Good, because it significantly improves user understanding, and it does not require the user to navigate away for the information.
- Potential negative, because some purist tarot readers may disapprove of the addition of labels.

## Validation
The decision will be validated through user feedback and app reviews.
