# Using an Image for Homepage Background

## Context and Problem Statement

Our homepage currently just in black which lacks visual appeal and fails to captivate users. We've identified the need to make the homepage more engaging and compelling, and we're considering the idea of using a large, captivating image related to fortune-telling as a background.

## Decision Drivers
- A visually appealing homepage could potentially increase the time users spending on.
- The image should represent or relate to our fortune-telling .

## Considered Options
- Use a static image as the homepage background
- Use a dynamic image, falling star effect as homepage background.

## Decision Outcome
Chosen option: *"Use a static image as the homepage background"*, because using live wallpapers will affect performance as well as require complexity in design. Whereas, the static wallpaper still meets the requirements of creating an eye-catching visual homepage without requiring complicated designs.

## Consequences
- Good, because the static image will add visual appeal and can be optimized for minimal impact on load time.
- Bad, because choosing the wrong image could potentially misrepresent the layout or content of our fortune-telling.
