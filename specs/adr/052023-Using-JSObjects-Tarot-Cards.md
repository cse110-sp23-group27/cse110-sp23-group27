# Use JSObjects to represent tarot cards in the code

## Context and Problem Statement

When the user clicks on the tarot card, how should the tarot card information be retrieved?

How to select a random tarot card when the cards are shuffled in JS Code?

## Decision Drivers

We wanted to determine how we would represent Tarot cards in our JS code. 

We wanted to determine how we should retrieve the responses for the Tarot cards.

## Considered Options

* JS Object
* String Array

## Decision Outcome
Chosen option: "JS Object", because multiple fields can store more information about the tarot cards in a more readable way.

For example, we can store the past, present and future responses of the tarot card as string fields in the object.

We can also store the image reference string of the tarot card as another field

## Pros and Cons of the Options
TBD

## More Information
TBD if decision modified/changed
