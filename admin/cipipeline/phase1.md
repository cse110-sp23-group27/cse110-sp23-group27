## Still in progress 

* Choosing an autoformatter to run locally before pushing
* Adding more thorough Jest unit tests
* Formal process for code review

## Planned

* Using JSDocs to generate documentation before pushing code
* Minification of the code
* Deployment of website to GitHub Pages (once functional)
* Adding E2E Jest testing (to be added when application is functional)
* Automatically linking Pull Request to Github Issue
