# Checkpoint 1 Documentation
Currently, our CI/CD pipeline is able to run unit tests using Jest as well as linting and code style enforcement using ESLint. We currently do not have many unit tests as we have not implemented much for our programm, however, as development progresses, we will be adding more unit tests. With ESLint, Javascript files are formatted by removing or adding indents and semicolons as necessary, and replacing single quote strings for double quote strings. We are planning to add automated documentation, possibly with JSDocs, and a code quality tool like CodeClimate. We will have to research into the benefits of both and any alternatives.
