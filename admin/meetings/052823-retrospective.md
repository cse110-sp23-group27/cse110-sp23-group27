## Agenda
- Review logistics
- What went wrong, what went well?

## Topic
### Need more comunication on issues:
- Some had issues where both started working on it without knowing someone else worked on it
- Need to ask and look for github issues in case someone already worked on it
- Need to ask first in slack to see if anybody has any ideas on it and if they want to collaborate together
- Since some issues are somewhat specific but are also sort of separate like the homepage it needs to be talked about in slack

### What went well:
- Documentation was very good
- Code style was great!
- Pull request quality was pretty good
- Division of work was very well done
- Not as many pull requests

### Next sprint
- Get Tarot cards done by Thursday of week 10
- We are still meeting on Week 10
