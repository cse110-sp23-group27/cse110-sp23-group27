## Sprint Reviews

Daniel:  
**What did you make this past sprint?**  
I worked on getting EsLint to follow certain formatting rules (google's formatting rules and other custom rules), I made an onboarding markdown document regarding the steps on pushing code to the branch, and I also worked on making the Tarot Card webpage functional with Elvis and Kevin.  
**What did you learn from it?**  
I learned a lot about how to work as a team (mob programming), working with bash scripts, and how to use EsLint and GitHub Actions.  
**What was your favorite part of it?**  
My favorite part was working with Kevin and Elvis on the tarot card functionality. I also enjoyed working on the GitHub actions EsLint formatter.  
**What blockers/issues do you still have?**  
One issue I am still facing is the bug regarding the tarot cards when the home button is clicked. The tarot cards do not disappear when the home page button is clicked. I think the tarot cards should reset when the home page button is clicked. 

Elvis:  
**What did you make this past sprint?**  
Helped out with the pipeline though not much. Worked on the Tarot Card functionality with Daniel and Kevin.  
**What did you learn from it?**  
I learned a lot about how GitHub actions works and what mob programming is like.  
**What was your favorite part of it?**  
It was fun working with others for the tarot card and pipeline.  
**What blockers/issues do you still have?**  
I am trying to make the code for the tarot card page easier to understand, and hopefully make it easier to implement the animation.  

Kevin:  
**What did you make this past sprint?**   
I made the color changing background for the on-hover buttons. This will be expanded to show pictures or videos later on.  
**What did you learn from it?**   
I learned about how difficult communication between teams can be, as well as how to try to manage time more effectively to get more progress done.  
**What was your favorite part of it?**   
I liked the collaborative part where Daniel, Elvis, and I figured out issues with the homepage together, because we came up with solutions that we couldn't come up with individually.  
**What blockers/issues do you still have?**   
I've had issues with being pretty busy these past week or so. I had a midterm and a large project due throughout the week so I wasn't as productive as I could've been.  

Trisha:  
**What did you make this past sprint?**  
I wrote the method headers for the TarotCard class and began working on writing some of the functions with Victor and Kyle.  
**What did you learn from it?**  
I learned more about CSS and how to use a singleton to implement objects.  
**What was your favorite part of it?**  
Getting to work with Victor and Kyle and see the direct results of our code when we tested functions.  
**What blockers/issues do you still have?**  
I'd like to improve on my understanding of the Animator class as well as CSS in general.

Jason:  
**What did you make this past sprint?**  
I made the imaged buttons for the Taro card, Egg, and Bone tossing with some hover on top of them, then resize and arrange the buttons to fit the homepage. I'm also working on the implementation of the burger bar for the pages.  
**What did you learn from it?**  
I learned a lot about the pipeline, GitHub issues, GitHub actions,... and I also learned that when working in a team, communication is very important.  
**What was your favorite part of it?**  
I liked the way we added the tests and ESlint so that we can have a clear guideline for everyone's collaboration, and also ensure that our codes are quality and stable before pushing them to the main branch.  
**What blockers/issues do you still have?**  
I'm still stuck on the burger bar's implementation. I try minimizing the bar's size and making the menu appear horizontally whenever the 'burger' button is clicked. I discussed with Elvis about that, I think we may fix it soon.  

Sean:  
**What did you make this past sprint?**  
I added a glow effect and fog to the tarot card page  
**What did you learn from it?**  
I learned more about CSS and how to write proper documentation for methods  
**What was your favorite part of it?**  
 I liked seeing my results and working on a larger code base with a team to see a large project grow.  
**What blockers/issues do you still have?**  
I was not in SD this weekend for a family trip, so I couldn’t make meetings or really put too much time into coding.  

Kyle Smith:  
**What did you make this past sprint?**  
I worked with Elvis and Daniel to get the CI/CD pipeline setup, including helping to create the CI/CD pipeline architecture diagram and ADR and GitHub Actions workflow. I also worked on getting a code quality tool setup for our GitHub repo and worked on functionality for the animator class, specifically the flip animation function.  
**What did you learn from it?**  
I learned a lot about how to setup a basic CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions and automated style checking and unit testing. I also learned more about JavaScript classes.  
**What was your favorite part of it?**  
My favorite part was working on setting up the CI/CD pipeline with Elvis and Daniel because we ran into several roadblocks while trying to integrate the style checking and unit testing tools into our GitHub Action automated workflow and I felt I learned a lot from my teammates who came up with excellent solutions while we were trying to overcome these issues.  
**What blockers/issues do you still have?**  
I’m still learning about the best way to integrate the Code Quality tool (Codacy) into the GitHub repository. It seems to provide some nice analytics on its dashboard, but I would like to integrate this information into our GitHub Action workflow, and also get the Code Quality and Test Coverage badges working for the GitHub main branch README.  

Victor:  
**What did you make this past sprint?**  
I made the Animator and some outline of the technical designs for how it would integrate with the Tarot Cards.  
**What did you learn from it?**  
It was interesting to work with scopes and think ahead on how it can be made to be easily reused in the future.  
**What was your favorite part of it?**  
Testing it was very fun, and making it a singleton felt like a nice solution to the problems presented.  
**What blockers/issues do you still have?**  
Still need to integrate with the rest of the Tarot Card class  

Kathy:  
**What did you make this past sprint?**
This past sprint I helped add the fog css styling to the tarot card animations as well as getting started on the home page design for the fortune telling app as a whole.
**What did you learn from it?**
I learned that the internet is a great resource to find references for adding certain features. Additionally, getting used to css and javascript syntax is difficult but it’s all part of the learning process!
**What was your favorite part of it?**
My favorite part was seeing the web app as a whole come into fruition - it’s nice to see that the difficult planning and organizing of meetings is resulting in a product that we can actually see!
**What blockers/issues do you still have?**
Still getting familiar with the github actions and working in a github repo with so many other contributors. Also just getting used to styling in general.

Kyle Ng:
**What did you make this past sprint?**
I made the json file for the tarot cards and worked on accessing the json file to use the data.
**What did you learn from it?**
I learned more about json and how to store and access data. I also learned more about JSObjects.
**What was your favorite part of it?**
My favorite part was just learning new things and working together as a group to build a whole project.
**What blockers/issues do you still have?**
No major issues so far. One small issue is just trying to keep up with what everyone else is doing, so that when I want to help work on something else I am able to.
