# What Went Wrong
* A little confusion with how certain features are being implement or what feature we wanted
* Agile is difficult when people are not avaliable 24/7
* People have different schedules, so hard to get everyone in meetings

# What Went Well
* Felt better this time around to get issues done since we had the base foundation of the website
* We had better communication and issues were divided well
* We got a lot more work done this sprint
* Pipeline was finished, so we could do pull request and merge more smoothly
* Pipline finished allowed people to test and now allow as many bugs into main
* Pull requests and reviews were done better, so CI/CD was better
* We were more thoughtful with code that was going into main
