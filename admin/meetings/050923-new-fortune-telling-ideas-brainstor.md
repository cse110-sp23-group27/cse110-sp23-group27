## Agenda
- Pick 2 more ideas for the long term fortune telling project and try to outline them a bit more
- 


## Topic  
Fortune telling ideas:

### Fortune telling wonton
- Maybe a wonton that you can drag around the screen with a mouth on bottom
- If you bring the wonton to the bottom you start eating it
- Once you eat the wonton you can read the fortune on the paper

### Bone tossing
- We are not sure how exactally this works as we did not do research yet
- It could be that position of the bones tells us something about our future
- Maybe there are predetermined positions which we assign to some text which we would then give to the user
- Maybe we could make the bones act as 2d vectors on a 2d map which would determine how good 

### Other fortune telling methods we found online 
From [here](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/ways-to-tell-the-future).
- Bibliomancy -> fortune telling from book texts
- Oomancy -> fortune telling from how the egg white cooks
  - Definition : divination by means of eggs
  - The shape of the egg white as it cooks is believed to offer clues about the future.

The egg divinations could be a fun alternative to the more grim tarot card project we are making

We decided to do Tarot cards, egg divination, and bone tossing. Partially because it could be more fun and because it has a different vibe from tarot.

We are moving on to doing the write up for the page from class.
