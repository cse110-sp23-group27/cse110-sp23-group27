## Sprint Reviews
 
Daniel Lee:  
**What did you make this past sprint?**  
Worked on E2E testing, reviewed merge requests, finished local storage implementation that tracks what cards you have found so far. I also finished setting up ESLint and making the pipeline a little less strict in terms of ESlint formatting  
**What did you learn from it?**  
I learned how to utilize local storage in javascript, how to create E2E tests in puppeteer, and how to review pull requests in GitHub.  
**What was your favorite part of it?**  
My favorite part was working with local storage and storing the cards that were shown or hidden. I also enjoyed getting the E2E tests to work.  
**What blockers/issues do you still have?**  
I had some issues with getting E2E tests to work at the first time, but I managed to get it to work after some trial and error. I don't have any current blockers or issues, but I have a lot of extra features I wanted to add but didn't have time   

Kevin Wong:  
**What did you make this past sprint?**  
I made the second burger bar and the image icons for said second burger bar.  
**What did you learn from it?**  
I learned that directly having someone assign tasks was really helpful, as well as having people constantly check in and ask for help when they need it helped boost our productivity.  
**What was your favorite part of it?**  
My favorite part of it was finally seeing the agile process start being used efficiently. We were bouncing off issues and asking each other to work on issues or small tasks. All the stuff we did was modularized and we fell into a rhythm on tasks we could make. We also were very clear on what we could and couldn't do.  
**What blockers/issues do you still have?**  
We are having issues with images loading a bit slowly, and we couldn't get service workers to function 100% of the time.  

Victor Kim:  
**What did you make this past sprint?**  
I worked on fixing the animations and moving them over to use promises. I also worked on just knocking out smaller bugs.  
**What did you learn from it?**  
I think that it made me realize how important initial design is.  
The class ended up less developed than I wanted it to be, and it might have ended up suffering from yagni as it was just for one project by the end of it.  
**What was your favorite part of it?**  
I liked that our pipeline ended up being set up and I felt like it made it much easier to make better changes.  
**What blockers/issues do you still have?**  
I currently do not have any blockers or issues.  

Kathy Chen:  
**What did you make this past sprint?**  
I worked on adding the past, present and future labels above the final 3 cards selected once they have been displayed. I also worked on fixing the image ratios of the cards.  
**What did you learn from it?**  
I learned more about how to use JavaScript to display the text on the card reveal screen and to remove the text when clicking to the home page. This involved adding and removing the text child element from the tarot div element. Additionally positioning the text on the page.  
**What was your favorite part of it?**  
My favorite part was seeing the text appear and disappear successfully with no bugs because all of my confusions were finally resolved.  
**What blockers/issues do you still have?**  
No blockers really, just have to study for finals  

Sean Fuhrman:  
**What did you make this past sprint?**  
I worked on the sizing and placement of the Tarot Cards, I added styling to the shuffle and reset buttons, I worked on card flipping animation with Kyle and I made the card's images only change once clicked.  
**What did you learn from it?**  
I learned that a good pipeline is very helpful, and it's important to keep an updated local version with main.  
**What was your favorite part of it?**  
My favorite part was better utilizing Github Issues to keep track of tasks done as it really helped understand the state of the project  
**What blockers/issues do you still have?**  
It was sometimes hard to work with other classes. Also with the code base getting larger I found it harder to add code without introducing a bug somewhere else, so we had to more extensively test changes.  

Trisha Tong:  
**What did you make this past sprint?**  
I worked on a fading text animation for the card descriptions and fixing the fog animation. Also worked on the local storage feature idea we had initially.  
**What did you learn from it?**  
I learned how efficient a team could be, which was something I think we improved a lot on during this sprint. I also learned about how we could use and implement local storage.  
**What was your favorite part of it?**  
My favorite part was implementing the fade-in feature because I got to see immediate results from the changes I added. I liked our flow of work and having assigned tasks despite it being finals season.  
**What blockers/issues do you still have?**  
I don't have any blockers or issues at this time.  

Jason Bui:  
**What did you make this past sprint?**  
I worked on styling for the homepage and applied some sound effects for the shuffle card animation. Also worked on the speech synthesis that read the response but it couldn't work as expected.  
**What did you learn from it?**  
I learned how to work as a team, also get used to with GitHub issues, GitHub action, and pipeline stuff. I've learned a lot about CSS and JS, which I have never known before.  
**What was your favorite part of it?**  
I liked the way our pipeline was set up which help our team work more efficiently.  
**What blockers/issues do you still have?**  
Still cannot make the speech synthesis work for the response.  

Elvis Joa:  
**What did you make this past sprint?**  
I worked on debugging, text display, and fixed the images that were not fitting. Also worked on reviewing the code and code refactoring, and tried to make service workers work.  
**What did you learn from it?**  
I learned how to actually review code and catch errors that are not covered by the automated testing.  
**What was your favorite part of it?**  
Being able to minimize how much I had to check since the pipeline and testing was set up pretty well.  
**What blockers/issues do you still have?**  
I could not figure out how to make service workers work consistently.  

Kyle Smith:  
**What did you make this past sprint?**  
I worked on the CI/CD pipeline with CSS linter integration, code quality and code testing coverage. I also worked on adding tarot card flip animations.  
**What did you learn from it?**  
I learned the details on how to work with different code linters and integrate into GH actions, as well as using a test coverage tool called istanbul to check jest unit testing coverage and write more unit tests.  I also learned more about CSS when I was working on card flipping animation.  
**What was your favorite part of it?**  
I really enjoyed seeing the CI/CD pipeline mature during this sprint, to the point where a lot of bugs where being caught on locally, on push or during a pull request and kept out of the main branch, for the most part. Although the CSS tarot card flip animation didnâ€™t make it into production yet since it could not be throughly tested, I also had fun working on the CSS flip animation with Sean, seeing it work nicely and learning more about CSS.  
**What blockers/issues do you still have?**  
The CSS flip animation works, but introduces several small bugs and needs to be tested more throughly.  I also need to write more unit tests for the codebase to improve our coverage, and from now on unit tests should ideally accompany PRs for new code.  

Kyle Ng:  
**What did you make this past sprint?**  
I added a few features like a shadow box around the cards that are selected, header text, and worked on positioning the reset button. Other than this just worked on some styling, and fixing bugs.  
**What did you learn from it?**  
I learned the importance of having a good pipeline set up and dividing tasks well to allow members to work on their tasks at efficently at their own pace.  
**What was your favorite part of it?**  
My favorite part was being able to work and debug features without having to worry too much if I am affecting other people's code. I enjoyed seeing how I could improve the website.  
**What blockers/issues do you still have?**  
Main issue is probably just time constraint on project, there were some features we could've added to improved certain aspects of a feature.
