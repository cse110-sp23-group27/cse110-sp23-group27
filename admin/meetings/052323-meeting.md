# Topic

General Information
- For GitHub issues, each member should create the issue they are working on
- The basic workflow was created over the weekend, so automatic tests will occuer when we push
- Testing can also now be done locally and when we push

GitHub Actions
- Kyle Smith found a way to test git hub actions locally
- He will make a document in the repo explaing how to do it

GitHub Workflow
- We explained how the basic workflow works to the members that weren't able to be present
- You can run the tests locally through nmp tests
- You can also test formatting (ESLint) locally
- When you push, github actions will also run all the tests automatically to make sure they pass

Unit Tests
- People who make a feature should make units tests for that part

Branches
- Create a new branch for each feature you are creating
- Make sure to delete stale branches or branches that you are done with
- Make sure to commit/push often
