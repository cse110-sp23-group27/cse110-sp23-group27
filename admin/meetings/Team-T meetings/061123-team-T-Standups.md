**How are you doing?**  
Doing good, gonna do 101 midterm so hopefully that goes well.  
**Have you been able to make progress?**  
I worked a bit on putting the images on top of the buttons.  
**Any issues?**  
When I tried images with transparent backgrounds, the button could still be seen, so I have to see if I can make the images the buttons, instead of putting images on top of buttons.

I'm doing good, I have been working on some pipeline problems regarding gitignore and github actions pushing unrelated files.

**Have you been able to make progress?**  
I've made a basic addition for changing backgrounds on hover, and have started researching different ways to implement fog(although that task appears to have been resolved by team A).  
**Any issues?**  
Not at the moment, I had some issues with the fog, but that's out of my jurisdiction now, so I'll be working more on semantics and styling!
